## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In this analysis, we hope to examine the factors impacting overall customer flight satisfaction and find the area that determines service satisfaction the most. We are interested in this topic because it is a blend of our group interests. We have two group members with interests in psychology, and one with interests in marketing. This dataset includes areas of flight impacting customer satisfaction, from a psychological view it is interesting to see which factors are most important to individuals when determining their level of satisfaction beginning from booking the flights to the point they pick up their baggage at the destination airport. From a marketing perspective, it is interesting to see how the airline will prioritize which aspects of the flights to market to customers over others based on the impact on satisfaction. As we feel that the following factors may have the most impact, we specifically want to look at the impact of online services, delay in arrivals and departures, and in-flight services and factors which impact flight satifaction.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was created 3 years ago by an unnamed airline company referred to as Invistico airlines. The purpose of collecting this dataset was for the airline company to determine which areas involved in flights needed more attention in order to increase the levels of customer satisfaction with the services. Along with this, the data was also used for the airline company to predict satisfaction levels in future customers based on similar demographic information with previous customers. Our data includes both demographic information about each customer including age, gender, class of travel, and others as well as levels of satisfaction in various categories, including seat comfort, food and drink quality, and inflight entertainment. This information comes from previous customers of the airline reflecting on their experience after their flight. We suspect that ease of online booking, cleanliness and flight delays have the biggest impacts on overall customer satisfaction.

## Team Members

- *Sara*: I have a dipolma in business administration and currently am majoring in psychology so I am curious if these three factors truly affect flight satisfaction.
- *Mataija*: I am also currently majoring in psychology and am interested in using data visualizations to see if flight delays affect customer satisfaction.
- *Daniel*: I am pursuing a degree in Business Management (maybe a minor in Computer Science), so these three factors from the dataset may relate to marketing, providing me with an insight into the airline industry.
