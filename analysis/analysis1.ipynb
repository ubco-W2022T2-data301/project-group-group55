    "- Data Analysis Plan\n",
    "    - I plan on subsetting the satisfaction, online boarding, ease of online booking, and age columns from the dataset to determine if there is a trend between whether the customer's satisfaction is affected by the level of ease in booking flight tickets online and ability to board online. First I will clean the data to ensure neither of the factors contain NA or null. The determination of the ease of online booking and online boarding uses a scale of 0 to 5, where 0 is not accessible and 5 is very accessible. To use Pearson's r to find the correlation of the variables, it will be easier for me to convert all variables into a numerical values to separate between satisfied and disatified customers and analyze the scores between the ease of online booking scores, online boarding, and age of customers."
