Then, I will make two graphs, one for arrival delay and one for departure delay looking at the level of satisfaction for customers based on their type of travel, possibly sorted into time intervals to condense the data in the graph and make it easier to read, to see which type of delay causes a bigger decrease in satisfaction. I will then do the same for graphs of loyalty status to compare the two.\n"
