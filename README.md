## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In this analysis, we hope to examine the factors impacting overall customer flight satisfaction and find the area that determines satisfaction the most. We are interested in this topic because it is a blend of our group interests. We have two group members with interests in psychology, and one with interests in marketing. This dataset includes areas of flight impacting customer satisfaction, from a psychology view it is interesting to see which factors are most important to people when determining their level of satisfaction with the whole flight. From a marketing perspective, it is interesting to see how the airline will choose which aspects of the flight to market to customers over others based on how much they impact satisfaction. We specifically want to look most at the ease of online booking, cleanliness of the plane, and flight delay and their impacts on satifaction. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was created 3 years ago by an unnamed airline company referred to as Invistico airlines. The purpose of this dataset was for the airline company to determine which areas involved in flights needed more attention in order to increase the levels of customer satisfaction with the company. Along with this, the data was also used for the airline company to predict satisfaction levels in future customers based on similar demographic information with previous customers. Our data includes both demographic information about each customer including age, gender, class of travel, and others as well as levels of satisfaction in various categories, including seat comfort, food and drink quality, and inflight entertainment. This information comes from previous customers of the airline reflecting on their experience after their flight. We suspect that ease of online booking, cleanliness and flight delays have the biggest impacts on overall customer satisfaction.
