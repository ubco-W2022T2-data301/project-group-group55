# Introduction
The airline customer satisfaction dataset had our interest as it seemed to reflect the blend of our group’s interests in business management and psychology. This dataset contains a wide range of ratings on flight services such as on-board service, on-board wifi, delays, and online services. Additionally, the rate of “satisfied” or “dissatisfied”, customer’s age, loyalty status, and travel type were included. To determine the areas where customers’ needs were not met and whether there is a trend in influence on satisfaction, data was compiled to answer a few questions as below:

- Does ease of online booking, online boarding, and online support affect flight satisfaction and if so, does age and travel type matter?
- Does the relationship between flight distance and total flight delay time leave more loyal or disloyal customers dissatisfied with the flight, and are customers traveling for personal or business reasons more likely to be dissatisfied due to this relationship?
- How do the on-flight service factors such as seat comfort, leg-room, on-board service correlate to each other? Do the ages change depending on how these factors are rated?

Collecting survey data such as this one to analyze areas that require further attention and amendments enables businesses to determine bottlenecks in processes and departments. 
Our group chose this topic because it is a blend of our interests. We have two members interested in psychology, and one interested in business which led us towards looking at datasets related to marketing to incorporate both topics. We settled on this dataset analyzing airline customer satisfaction in regards to experience in a variety of categories. This dataset appealed to us because it collected customer ratings of a large number of variables, many of which we found interesting to examine. 


# Exploratory Data Analysis

The following steps describe the exploratory data analysis for each question mentioned above. 
The first question, “Does ease of online booking, online boarding, and online support affect flight satisfaction, and if so, does age and travel type matter?” was answered by creating a subset of the raw dataset. The columns satisfaction, age, type of travel, ease of online booking, online boarding, and online support were extracted for the analysis. Then, the age of customers was grouped into “0-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70+” for a better visualization of differences in age groups. The age group, type of travel, and satisfaction columns were used as independent variables, and the ease of online booking, online boarding, and online support were used as dependent variables to compare the rate of online services. To find the most visible effects, satisfaction was considered first, then type of travel, and then age range, as any other order produced graphs that did not have any discernible trends. 

To explore the second research question, “Does the relationship between flight distance and total flight delay time leave more loyal or disloyal customers dissatisfied with the flight, and are customers traveling for personal or business reasons more likely to be dissatisfied due to this relationship?”, a new column was created to account for the entire amount of flight delay, both arrival delay and departure delay combined. Any outliers were removed from all categories, and graphs were examined to visualize the relationships between customer satisfaction and delay. To dig deeper into this relationship, the role of more group variables was investigated to see the more specific differences. Both the type of travel—personal or business—and loyalty status of the customer were factors in the exploration. After finding group differences, other variables were investigated to see if there were any other visible differences between these groups. Flight distance was investigated in regards to the type of travel and loyalty status of the customer, as the different groups appeared to also have differences in their satisfaction levels. To clean up the data, a subset was created only including the columns measuring satisfaction, type of travel, loyalty status, total delay, and flight distance. 

Lastly, exploring the third research question, “How do the on-flight service factors such as seat comfort, leg-room, on-board service correlate to each other? Do the ages change depending on how these factors are rated?” was completed very similarly to the first research question. Firstly, the columns representing the on-flight service factors leg-room service, onboard service, seat comfort, satisfaction, and age—were extracted from the raw dataset for the analysis. To provide a clearer visualization of age, it was grouped into the following ranges “<19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, and 70+”. Throughout the analysis, the independent variable was always age, whereas the dependent variables were either one of the on-flight services or satisfaction as a whole. N/A or null values were also removed to provide a cleaner dataset to work with and so that clear observations could be made.  


# RQ1: Does ease of online booking, online boarding, and online support affect flight satisfaction and if so, does age and travel type matter?

For the online support ratings (rated 0-5), satisfied business travelers aged 20-29 and 70+ rated the lowest, with an average of 3.632 and 3.676, respectively. For dissatisfied business travelers, customers under 29 years old rated less than 3, but those above rated just above 3. There wasn’t a distinguishable trend in personal travelers for both those who were satisfied and those who were dissatisfied, although as age increases, the average rate of online support also increases. This is unexpected, as younger individuals were hypothesized to rate higher with better technology knowledge. Both the dissatisfied business travelers’ online boarding and online booking rates (rated 0-5) show a decline in rate as age increases. Satisfied business travelers aged over 70 rated online booking the lowest with an average of 3.564, followed by the age group 20-29 with an average of 3.685. Similarly, satisfied business travelers aged 20-29 rated the lowest at 3.684. However, among the rates of dissatisfied business travelers for both services, individuals aged 20-29 rated the highest. In terms of type of travel, business traveler rates (Δ Avg. Support = 12%; Δ Avg. Boarding = 7.0%; Δ Avg. Booking = 9.0%; in terms of highest Δ) had more variation in rates between age groups than personal travelers (Δ Avg. Support = 3.5%; Δ Avg. Boarding = 2.7%; Δ Avg. Booking = 3.1%; in terms of highest Δ), indicating the need for further research. This data contains some contradictions and needs further investigation through the further gathering of surveys and analysis. 


# Does the relationship between flight distance and total flight delay time leave more loyal or disloyal customers dissatisfied with the flight, and are customers traveling for personal or business reasons more likely to be dissatisfied due to this relationship?

Does the relationship between flight distance and total flight delay time leave more loyal or disloyal customers dissatisfied with the flight, and are customers traveling for personal or business reasons more likely to be dissatisfied due to this relationship? To begin, the satisfaction levels based on the total minutes of delay as well as the satisfaction levels based on the distance of the flight were determined. These results show that both high flight delays and high flight distances have high amounts of both customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction, however, the levels are opposite of each other, with flight delays showing higher levels of dissatisfaction but flight delays having higher levels of customer satisfaction.

To investigate the cause of this further, the type of customer travel was factored in. This caused a huge difference between the groups of personal travel vs. business travel for the levels of satisfaction and dissatisfaction dependent on total flight delay and flight distance. There is a higher level of both satisfaction and dissatisfaction in relation to larger total flight delay times and longer flight distances for business travel compared to personal travel. The huge difference between the groups shows that the type of travel is a large co​​ntributor to how satisfied the traveler is with their trip overall. This is not what was originally expected as personal travel is a huge investment for many, and therefore high levels of dissatisfaction were expected to be seen in the personal travel group with large total delay times as it is their own money invested in the trip. The data actually shows higher levels of dissatisfaction in the business travel group compared to the personal travel group. A possible explanation for this could be the tight schedule with meetings and deadlines that come with work and business trips that may make the delays or traveling far distances more stressful and therefore cause less satisfaction. The increase in satisfaction in business travel compared to personal travel could be attributed to those business travelers who are happy to be away from the office or are excited for their project and are less concerned with the delays and distance to travel.

Finally, to explore the relationship even more, the variable of loyal and disloyal customers was added. The results show that loyal customers are much more likely to be both satisfied and dissatisfied, regardless of the type of travel. As well, there are very low values for personal travel and disloyal customers in both conditions, but very high results for loyal personal travel customers and both loyal and disloyal business travelers. The very apparent split between participants within each type of travel was only uncovered after adding the loyalty variable, which signifies its importance to the analysis. A possible explanation for this could be the fact that more people who were loyal travelers to the airline were surveyed. This could be because it is easier to reach out to previous travelers who have signed up for emails or newsletters from the company, and those people may be more likely to answer the survey because they have more information to share about the airline because they feel more personally invested in it. Along with this, business travelers may fly more frequently due to career duties and therefore may be more enticed to have a favorite airline and stay loyal to that airline, perhaps also collecting airline rewards programs that would further incentivize them to stay loyal to the airline. The disloyal personal travelers may not be flying as much, and because of that, they may not be as invested in the airline or answering the survey, leading to the significant decrease in responses from them.

# How do the on-flight service factors such as seat comfort, leg-room, on-board service correlate to each other? Do the ages change depending on how these factors are rated?

![](https://github.com/ubco-W2022T2-data301/project-group-group55/blob/main/images/DanielGraphs.png)

Firstly, looking at the bar graphs, we may be able to conclude that onflight service factors are pretty much just subjective throughout the age groups. This can be determined as throughout each age group and different onflight service factor, the majority of the ratings of satisfied or dissatisfied are more or less equally distributed. This could be due to factors such as people being less picky/more picky, some having ongoing health issues like back problems, which may impact their choice, and many more factors. To go into detail, throughout each service, it was noticeable that the age groups 40-49 and 50-59 had a higher percentage of satisfied people than dissatisfied people. This could be because this likely includes most of the people who have a lot of flying experience; hence, they are used to these services and may be lenient when it comes to the ratings. 

Onto the line graph, where I created a column called average rating and compared them per age group. As the graph is pretty straight, this shows that their age did not have a very significant impact on their satisfaction with the onlfight services. However, to go into detail, age groups 40-49 and 50-59 had the highest average rating of 3.38 and 3.40 respectively, while the age groups 20-29 and 70+ had the lowest average rating of 3.12 and 3.03 respectively.

Overall, the differences in satisfaction are not very significant.


# Conclusion

For the analysis of the research questions “Does ease of online booking, online boarding, and online support affect flight satisfaction, and if so, does age and travel type matter?”, “Does the relationship between flight distance and total flight delay time leave more loyal or disloyal customers dissatisfied with the flight, and are customers traveling for personal or business reasons more likely to be dissatisfied due to this relationship?”, and “How do the on-flight service factors such as seat comfort, leg-room, on-board service correlate to each other? Do the ages change depending on how these factors are rated?”, raw data from Kaggle was taken to conduct an exploratory data analysis. The parameters of subsets were made according to each question, which was used to create graphs. The analysis of the graphs led to the following recommendations to increase the accuracy of inferential statistics, which may help improve the customer repetition rate; First, the analysis of this dataset shows that further investigation into the needs of business travelers, especially those rated satisfied and aged 20-29, is required to get a better depiction as more variation in rates was shown. Research also suggests dissatisfied business travelers over 50 rate lower on all three online services (boarding, support, and booking).
